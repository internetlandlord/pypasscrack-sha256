# pypasscrack-sha256
SHA256 Password Cracker

(This tool has been developed in part using material from TCM's Python for Hackers course.)

This tool takes a command-line argument of a SHA256 hash digest, and uses a wordlist
(in this case, rockyou.txt) to generate hashes and compare against the CLI input.

Progress is logged to the console while hash cracking is performed
